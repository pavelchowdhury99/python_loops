1. Intuition

Let us take a step back and first understand why do we program. For some it
would be to do some tasks that would consume a lot of time if done manually. So essentially 
it is an automation of manual tasks in it's core. An the most fundamental things in programings are 
logic statements, if this do that else if this do that thing of thing. 

However you must have come accross senarios where such statements or operations are
to be done for a lot of entities, so say you have a set of natural number from 1 till n and you want
to check if they are even or odd, you would have to write n if statements to get the results.
Which is of course not in line with the reson why we went programing in the first place.

So in order to avoid writing same statements for multiple entities we use loops.
Loops are statements which would execute all the statements within them untill the set/range/condition on which
it is looping is terminated.
